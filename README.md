Approximately 5% of Indonesia's population, or over 22 million people, have disabilities, with a significant portion facing hearing impairments. Despite these numbers, awareness and proficiency in sign language remain limited among the general population​ (International Journalists' Network)​. In Indonesia, many individuals struggle to master sign language, creating a communication barrier between the hearing and deaf communities. This gap hinders social inclusion and access to essential services for the deaf and hard of hearing.

The SignMate application is a technological innovation aimed at improving communication accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments. Our app provides a comprehensive platform for learning, practicing and using sign language in a variety of everyday contexts. With features like an interactive sign dictionary, customized learning lessons and this app allows users to communicate effectively with people around us. Additionally, social features and community support expand the app's benefits by creating a space for collaboration and exchange of experiences between users.

SignMate aims to bridge this communication gap by providing an accessible and effective platform for learning Indonesian Sign Language (SIBI). Our goal is to make sign language learning easy and engaging for everyone, fostering a more inclusive society.

SignMate leverages technology to offer interactive sign language courses, community support, and real-time practice opportunities. By integrating features like video tutorials, quizzes, and a supportive user community, SignMate provides a comprehensive learning experience.
